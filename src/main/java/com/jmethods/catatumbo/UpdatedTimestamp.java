/**
 * Annotation for automatically setting the entity's modification timestamp. This annotation can be
 * applied to a field of an {@link Entity} or {@link MappedSuperClass}. Only one field can have this
 * annotation in a given Entity hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>Valid data types for the field include -
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Date}
 *   <li>{@link Calendar}
 *   <li>{@link Long}
 *   <li>long
 *   <li>{@link OffsetDateTime}}
 *   <li>{@link ZonedDateTime}}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The framework sets the field with this annotation during the following operations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>INSERT - Any variation of the insert methods automatically set the field with this
 *       annotation to the current JVM's timestamp. Furthermore, if the entity also has a field with
 *       {@link CreatedTimestamp} annotation, the framework ensures that both creation and
 *       modification timestamp are exactly equal.
 *   <li>UPDATE - Any variation of the update methods set this field to the current timestamp of the
 *       JVM.
 *   <li>UPSERT - Any variation of the upsert methods set this field to the current timestamp of the
 *       JVM.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The field with this annotation is no different than any other property of the entity. This
 * means, this field could also have the {@link Property} annotation and specify the property name
 * to use in the Datastore as well as whether or not the property should be indexed. The field will
 * be mapped using the specified {@link Mapper}, if a {@link PropertyMapper} is specified, otherwise
 * a default mapper for the data type is used.
