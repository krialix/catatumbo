/**
 * Specifies that a class is a Projected Entity. ProjectedEntity is similar to a regular {@link
 * Entity}, but typically contains a subset of fields of an entity. Projected Entities are useful
 * for mapping the results of a projection query.
 *
 * <p>Note that results of a projection query can be mapped to an {@link Entity}, but having a
 * {@link ProjectedEntity} helps accidental data loss (e.g. persisting an entity mapped from a
 * projection query). The EntityManager restricts persistence of ProjectedEntities. To clarify this
 * further, INSERT, UPDATE and UPSERT operations are not allowed on ProjectedEntities. DELETE
 * operations are still valid on Projected Entities.
