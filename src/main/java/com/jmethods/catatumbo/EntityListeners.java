/**
 * Specifies the callback listener classes to be used for an entity. This annotation may be applied
 * to:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Entity classes (classes that have an annotation of {@link Entity}).
 *   <li>Mapped super classes (classes that have an annotation of {@link MappedSuperClass}).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The listeners will be invoked in the order they are defined. The order of execution is as
 * follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Default Listeners</strong> - Default listeners are {@link EntityListener}s that are
 *       registered with the entity manager using {@link
 *       EntityManager#setDefaultListeners(Class...)}. Default listeners are invoked for all types
 *       of entities that are managed by the {@link EntityManager}.
 *   <li><strong>External Listeners</strong> - External listeners are attached to an {@link Entity}
 *       or {@link MappedSuperClass} using the {@link EntityListeners} annotation. Super class
 *       listeners are executed first, followed by subclass' listeners.
 *   <li><strong>Internal Listeners</strong> - Internal listeners are callback methods defined
 *       within the {@link Entity} or {@link MappedSuperClass}. The signature of these methods
 *       differs slightly from the signature of methods in the {@link EntityListener}. The signature
 *       should be of the form <code>public void methodName()</code>. Internal listeners defined in
 *       the super class are executed first and then the subclass listeners.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It is possible to exclude the execution of Default Listeners and listeners defined in the
 * super classes (both external and internal) using the annotations {@link ExcludeDefaultListeners}
 * and {@link ExcludeSuperclassListeners} annotations, respectively.
 *
 * <p>Callback methods may throw RuntimeExceptions. All RuntimeExceptions will be re-thrown as
 * {@link EntityManagerException} with the original exception set as the cause.
