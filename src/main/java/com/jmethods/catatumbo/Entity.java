/**
 * Specifies that a class is an entity. Classes with this annotation can be managed by the {@link
 * EntityManager} to save objects to the Cloud Datastore and load objects from the Cloud Datastore.
 *
 * <p>Entity Classes and other persistence classes ({@link Embeddable}, {@link MappedSuperClass})
 * may either use classic Java Beans pattern or the Builder pattern. Builder Pattern is recommended
 * when persistence objects that need to be immutable.
 *
 * <p>Classes annotated with this annotation must adhere to the following rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If using the classic Java Beans pattern, the class must have a public no-arg (zero
 *       arguments) constructor. Absence of a public no-arg constructor assumes that the class is
 *       using the Builder pattern.
 *   <li>For Builder pattern, the class must have a public static {@code newBuilder} or {@code
 *       builder} method that returns an instance of corresponding Builder class.
 *   <li>When using the Builder pattern, the Builder class must have a public {@code build} method.
 *   <li>Must have exactly one field annotated with @{@link Identifier} annotation.
 *   <li>The type of identifier field must be a supported type as defined in the {@link Identifier}
 *       documentation.
 *   <li>May contain zero or more fields. All fields that need to be persisted to the Cloud
 *       Datastore must have public accessor methods.
 *   <li>For classic Java Beans pattern, all persistable fields must also have their corresponding
 *       mutator methods.
 *   <li>For the Builder pattern, all persistable fields must have their corresponding mutator
 *       methods in the Builder class. The mutator methods may use any of the below naming
 *       conventions:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>setXXX (e.g. {@code setFirstName})
 *         <li>withXXX (e.g. {@code withFirstName})
 *         <li>xxx (e.g. {@code firstName})
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>If a field is to be skipped by the EntityManager, it needs to have @ {@link Ignore}
 *       annotation.
 *   <li>May have no more than one field with @{@link Key} annotation which will hold the full key
 *       to the entity.
 *   <li>Field annotated with @{@link Key} must have a data type of {@link DatastoreKey} .
 *   <li>May have no more than one field with @{@link ParentKey} annotation which will hold the full
 *       key to the parent entity.
 *   <li>Field annotated with @{@link ParentKey} must have a data type of {@link DatastoreKey}.
 *   <li>May have zero or more embedded objects with an annotation of @{@link Embedded}.
 *   <li>All other fields can be any of the types for which a {@link Mapper} exists. The framework
 *       provides Mappers for various commonly used types. CustomMappers can be specified using
 *       {@link MapperFactory#setDefaultMapper(java.lang.reflect.Type, Mapper)} or {@link
 *       PropertyMapper} annotation.
 * </ul>
