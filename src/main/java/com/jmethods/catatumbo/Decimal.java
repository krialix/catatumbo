/**
 * Specifies that the annotated field is of type decimal (aka numeric). This annotation can be
 * applied to any BigDecimal field of an Entity, MappedSuperClass or Embeddable. When this
 * annotation is present on a field, the persistence framework attaches a custom mapper, {@link
 * DecimalMapper}, to map the data between model and Cloud Datastore. The custom mapper stores the
 * data as a 64-bit integer in the Cloud Datastore. When reading data from the Datastore, the mapper
 * converts the 64-bit integer to a BigDecimal based on the specified scale.
 *
 * <p><strong> WARNING: <br>
 * DO NOT CHANGE THE SCALE WHEN THERE IS ALREADY DATA IN THE DATASTORE. DOING SO WILL YIELD
 * INCORRECT RESULTS. YOU MAY INCREASE THE PRECISION, BUT DO NOT DECREASE. IF IT IS NECESSARY TO
 * CHANGE THE PRECISION OR SCALE, EXISTING DATA MUST BE UPDATED BEFORE CHANGING YOUR ENTITY.
