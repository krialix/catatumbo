/**
 * Specifies a class whose instances are stored as an intrinsic part of an owning entity and share
 * the identity of the entity. Each of the persistent properties or fields of the embedded object
 * are mapped to the owning entity in the Cloud Datastore. An Embeddable can contain other
 * properties (with or without {@link Property} annotation). Further more, the embeddable objects
 * can contain other {@link Embedded} objects.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link Entity entities}, the Embeddable class may use either the classic Java Beans
 * pattern or the Builder pattern.
 *
 * <p>Embeddable classes must adhere to the following rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When using the classic Java Beans pattern, the class must have a public no-argument
 *       constructor
 *   <li>Absence of public no-argument constructor assumes the use of Builder pattern.
 *   <li>If using the Builder pattern, the class must have a public static method that returns an
 *       instance of Builder. The name of this method must be one of the following:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@code newBuilder}
 *         <li>{@code builder}
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>The Builder class must have a public {@code build} method that returns an instance of
 *       Embeddable.
 *   <li>For each persistable field, there must be corresponding accessor methods.
 *   <li>When using the classic Java Beans pattern, each persistable field must have a corresponding
 *       mutator method.
 *   <li>When using the Builder pattern, each persistable field must have a corresponding mutator
 *       method in the Builder class. The mutator methods must follow any of the below naming
 *       convention:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>setXXX (e.g. {@code setFirstName})
 *         <li>withXXX (e.g. {@code withFirstName})
 *         <li>xxx (e.g. {@code firstName})
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>Fields that should not be persisted, must be annotated with @{@link Ignore} annotation.
 *   <li>Complex objects may be present in the Embeddable class, as long as they have an annotation
 *       of @{@link Embedded} or @{@link Ignore}
 *   <li>Persistable fields may have @{@link Property} annotation to map the field with a custom
 *       name as well as to specify if the property should be indexed.
 *   <li>Embeddable objects must not have {@link Identifier}s, {@link Key}s or {@link ParentKey}s.
 *       Even if they contain these annotations, they are ignored.
 * </ul>
