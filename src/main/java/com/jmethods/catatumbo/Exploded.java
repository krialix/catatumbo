/**
 * Indicates that the {@link Embedded} object of an entity should be stored using the Exploded
 * strategy. With Exploded strategy, the {@link Embedded} object, and nested embedded objects, if
 * any, are exploded into separate properties when stored into the Datastore. This annotation can
 * exist on any {@link Embedded} field of an {@link Entity} or {@link MappedSuperClass}. Annotating
 * a nested Embedded field with this annotation will not have any effect as the storage strategy is
 * enforced at the Entity level.
