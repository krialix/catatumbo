/**
 * Annotation for automatically setting the entity's creation timestamp. This annotation can be
 * applied to a field of an {@link Entity} or {@link MappedSuperClass}. Only one field can have this
 * annotation in a given Entity hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>Valid data types for the field include -
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Date}
 *   <li>{@link Calendar}
 *   <li>{@link Long}
 *   <li>long
 *   <li>{@link OffsetDateTime}}
 *   <li>{@link ZonedDateTime}}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When inserting entities (any variation of insert methods) that have a field with this
 * annotation, the framework sets the corresponding Datastore property to the current timestamp as
 * returned by the host JVM. Any value set in the entity will be ignored/overwritten.
 *
 * <p>Update and Upsert operations ignore this annotation, meaning the field does not get any
 * special treatment during UPSERT or UPDATE operations. However, any value set in the entity (may
 * be null) will be persisted to the Datastore.
 *
 * <p>The field with this annotation is no different than any other property of the entity. This
 * means, this field could also have the {@link Property} annotation and specify the property name
 * to use in the Datastore as well as whether or not the property should be indexed. The field will
 * be mapped using the specified {@link Mapper}, if a {@link PropertyMapper} is specified, otherwise
 * a default mapper for the data type is used.
