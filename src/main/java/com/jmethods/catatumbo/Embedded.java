/**
 * Specifies a persistent property of an entity whose value is an instance of an embeddable class.
 * The embeddable class must be annotated as {@link Embeddable}.
 *
 * <p>Embedded objects in an entity can be stored using two strategies:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>EXPLODED</strong> - Each primitive field (processed recursively, if the embedded
 *       object contains nested embedded objects) in the embedded object is created as a separate
 *       property in the Cloud Datastore.
 *   <li><strong>IMPLODED</strong> - The embedded object and any nested embedded objects will be
 *       stored as a single property in the Cloud Datastore. The type of the property in the
 *       Datastore will be Embedded Entity.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>By default, Embedded objects are stored using the EXPLODED strategy. To change the strategy to
 * IMPLODED, simply add the {@link Imploded} annotation to the Embedded field. You may also annotate
 * the field explicitly with the {@link Exploded} annotation.
 *
 * <p>The class that has an Embedded field, must have a corresponding accessor methods. For example,
 * if <code>homeAddress</code> is of type <code>Address</code> and is a field defined in <code>
 * Person</code> class, then the <code>Person</code> class must have <code>
 * setHomeAddress(Address homeAddress)</code> and <code>Address getHomeAddress()</code> methods.
