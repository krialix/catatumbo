/**
 * Designates a class whose mapping information is applied to the entities that inherit from it. A
 * class designated with the MappedSuperclass annotation can be mapped in the same way as an entity
 * except that the mappings will apply only to its subclasses. This means, a MappedSuperClass may
 * contain fields with {@link Identifier}, {@link Key}, {@link ParentKey}, {@link Property}, {@link
 * Embedded} and {@link Ignore} annotations. The mapping information defined in the MappedSuperClass
 * can be overridden by the Entity using the {@link PropertyOverrides} and {@link PropertyOverride}
 * annotations. This allows an entity to use a different property name or turn on/off the indexing
 * of a property.
 *
 * <p>It is legal for a MappedSuperClass extend from another MappedSuperClass.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link Entity entities}, the MappedSuperClass may also use either the classic Java Beans
 * pattern or the Builder pattern. Subclasses of MappedSuperClass must use the same design pattern.
